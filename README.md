## 🧠 How It Works

The calculator uses **monthly compounding** and iteratively applies interest to ensure accuracy.

**Logic:**
- Annual interest rate is converted to a monthly rate
- Investment grows month-by-month
- Monthly contributions are added each cycle
- Results include:
  - Final balance
  - Total contributions
  - Interest earned

This approach mirrors real financial systems more closely than simple formula shortcuts.
